# Input/Output Basics

# input and output are essential to having a dynamic program
# Abbreviated - I/O
# output - puts, print
# input - gets

puts "What is your name?"
print "> "

name = gets.chomp

puts "Nice to meet you #{name}."

# input types - keyboard, files, etc.
# output types - screen, files, databases, etc.

# reading data - output, writing data - input
# File class -> parent IO class
